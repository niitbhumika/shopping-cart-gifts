**This is my first project**<br>
**INTRODUCTION**<br>
At the very core of an online storefront is the shopping cart system that enables customers to find and purchase products and services.In online marketing, a shopping cart is a piece of e-commerce software on a web server that allows visitors to an Internet site to select items for eventual purchase.The software allows online shopping customers to accumulate a list of items for purchase, described metaphorically as “placing items in the shopping cart” or “add to cart.” Upon checkout, the software typically calculates a total for the order, including shipping and handling (i.e., postage and packing) charges and the associated taxes, as applicable.

**Technical definition** <br>
These applications typically provide a means of capturing a client's payment information, but in the case of a credit card they rely on the software module of the secure gateway provider, in conjunction with the secure payment gateway, in order to conduct secure credit card transactions online.Some setup must be done in the HTML code of the website, and the shopping cart software must be installed on the server which hosts the site, or on the secure server which accepts sensitive ordering information.
Data (products, categories, discounts, orders, customers, etc.) is normally stored in a database and accessed in real time by the software.Shopping Cart Software is also known as e-commerce software, e-store software, online store software or storefront software and online shop.<br>
